                      A Brazilian Software Engineer, well-rounded (+10 Yrs) in IT. You should expect a person with
                      agile behaviour, design patterns in the mindset that loves Linux that will build user-centred
                      design with proper documentation.

                      PHP its a serious relationship, that started in 2007 and continue in a few applications. In may 8 2010
                      I said to Rasmus Lerdoff on IV ENSOL that I will be using this tecnology for a while...I didn't think
                      that could it be for more than 10 years, starting with pure PHP, going to Yii, Zend I, Zend II,
                      Yii 2, Magento 1 and later on Magento 2

                      Bash scripting its pure Linux love, I got this from the GNU/Linux community with old friends:
                      Victor, Anahuac and Rodrigo.<br />
                      I've learned since 2005 that a good script is a written down one, and later on some refactorings. <br />
                      It is something that I use/do every day, so if you need something related to a terminal line
                      I am your guy! <br />For more information check it out <Link to={{ pathname: 'https://github.com/strubloid/.bash_aliases' }} target="_blank" >Here</Link>

                      This was my digi-evolution from Node.Js, I could change the way that I was scripting with Javascript.
                      I follow the SOLID principles and always try to use as much as I can OO building good reusable components.
